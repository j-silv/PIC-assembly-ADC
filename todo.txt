 *************NOTE: 12/1/20 TODO DURING LAB:****************************

 -replace string message initializations with .idata section (using db directive
 for successive byte placements)
	IDATA
PTR_RESULT_MSG	DB	"U,D V\r\n"


 -constants indicating location for UNITY_OFFSET, DECIMAL_OFFSET (indexes
 for result msg string)
	CBLOCK
UNITY_OFFSET	0x00	; this would correspond to the index that the letter 'U' occupies
DECIMAL_OFFSET	0x02	; this would correspond to the index that the letter 'D' occupies

Thus when saving result to the U location after binary to decimal to ASCII conversion, the PTR_RESULT_MSG
could be loaded into FSR but with an offest of UNITY_OFFSET, and then the UNITY result could be written
to the location pointed by the FSR

 -place appropiate global/local variables in appropiate modules. for example,
 W_TEMP and STATUS_TEMP are only accessed in isr.asm module, so it makes more sense
 to place them there. TMR1_V_COUNT is only accessed between USART and TMR1 module,
 etc.

-in IDATA section, the PTR_RESULT_MSG/PTR_PROMPT MSG label should reserve appropiate number of bytes
needed to display message. -->
	IDATA
PTR_PROMPT_MSG DB "This is a test\r\n"
Using "" adds a null terminated character to the string
