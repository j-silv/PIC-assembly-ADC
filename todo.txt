 -replace string message initializations with .idata section (using db directive
 for successive byte placements)
	IDATA
PTR_RESULT_MSG	DB	"U,D V\r\n"


 -constants indicating location for UNITY_OFFSET, DECIMAL_OFFSET (indexes
 for result msg string)
	CBLOCK
UNITY_OFFSET	0x00	; this would correspond to the index that the letter 'U' occupies
DECIMAL_OFFSET	0x02	; this would correspond to the index that the letter 'D' occupies

Thus when saving result to the U location after binary to decimal to ASCII conversion, the PTR_RESULT_MSG
could be loaded into FSR but with an offest of UNITY_OFFSET, and then the UNITY result could be written
to the location pointed by the FSR

 -place appropiate global/local variables in appropiate modules. for example,
 W_TEMP and STATUS_TEMP are only accessed in isr.asm module, so it makes more sense
 to place them there. TMR1_V_COUNT is only accessed between USART and TMR1 module,
 etc.

-in IDATA section, the PTR_RESULT_MSG/PTR_PROMPT MSG label should reserve appropiate number of bytes
needed to display message. -->
	IDATA
PTR_PROMPT_MSG DB "This is a test\r\n"
Using "" adds a null terminated character to the string


If using IDATA, the values in memory are reserved BUT the intialization values are not put 
into these registers. The initialization values are in program memory!
The application code must then copy the initialization values from program memory to data memory at runtime.


The contents of the PCLATH register are
unchanged after a RETURN or RETFIE
instruction is executed. The user must
rewrite the contents of the PCLATH register for any subsequent subroutine calls or
GOTO instructions.

There are the 14 bit core psuedoinstructions, which are effectively built-in predefined macros 
(see MPASM/MPLINK user guide appendix A.6) LCALL and LGOTO, which simplify this by 
generating the instructions for the PAGESEL for the destination and the CALL or GOTO.   e.g on a midrange PIC16


fix why its not  going to the appropiate goto calll
